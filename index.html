  <a id="why" class="anchor" href="#why" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why
</h3>

<p>Because the number one outdoor city in america deserves the best outdoor map in america. Currently most organizations maintain their maps as images or PDFs which makes them inaccessible to both potential users and developers. Chattanooga needs one map to rule them all so that everyone has access to one amazingly designed outdoor map.</p>

<h3>
  <a id="what" class="anchor" href="#what" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What
</h3>

<p>An open (free) beautiful basemap designed specifically for outdoor activities. This map would be free to use on websites and mobile apps. This map would be created, designed and maintained by the community for the broader community as a whole. </p>
