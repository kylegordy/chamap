#Mapping Guide

##OpenStreetMap Mapping Best Practice
1. Respect existing mapped items, especially those that have been groundtruthed. 
2. Make sure trails connect to allow for routing within the trail network. 
3. Connect trails to roads at trailhead so that routing can continue from the road to the trail network. 
4. Use aerial photography to assit you in your mapping, but groundtruthing is always the best way to verify map features. (time to hit the trails!)

##OpenStreetMap Taggin Reference 
The National Parks Services have already created a [very detailed guide](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/US_National_Park_Service_Tagging) for how best to tag outdoor features in OpenStreetMap. For the time being this is a good resource to use when thinking about how best to tag the features you are mapping. Eventually the project may create something like this but this is a great reference to use in the mean time.
