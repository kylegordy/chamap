# ChaMap
One beautifully designed free outdoor basemap for the Chattanooga region. 

## Contribute
This project at it core consists of a free and open outdoor focused base map that anyone can use. The base map is created using openstreetmap, which you can think of as a kind of wikipedia for maps. There are several ways to contribute to the project. 

#### 1. Update the Map
Add your favorite outdoor recreation spot to the basemap using [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=13/35.0360/-85.3221&layers=C). If you haven't ever edited the map before check out [this](http://learnosm.org/en/) helpful guide that will get you up and mapping in no time. 
#### 2. Make the Map Pretty
Not only is the basemap open for anyone to improve, but the design of the basemap is also open as well. You can make [suggestions](https://github.com/openchattanooga/chamap-design/issues) of design changes to the basemap you would like to see or just make the changes yourself and submit them back to the [project](https://github.com/openchattanooga/chamap-design/). 
#### 3. Make the Project Website Awesome
[Help](https://github.com/openchattanooga/chamap/tree/gh-pages) update the [project website](http://openchattanooga.com/chamap/) to make finding and using the map as easy as possible. We need designers and copy editors to make the content compelling and coders to build the project website into a fully functional webapp that can be used to take the map on the trails. 
#### 4. Make it Mobile
Contribute to the [iPhone](https://github.com/openchattanooga/chamap-iphone-app) or [Andriod](https://github.com/openchattanooga/chamap-andriod-app) mobile app development. 

Project built with love from [Open Chattanooga](http://openchattanooga.com/).
