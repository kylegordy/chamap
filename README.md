2. [Suggest](https://github.com/openchattanooga/chamap-design) design changes to the basemap 
3. [Help](https://github.com/openchattanooga/chamap/tree/gh-pages) update the project website to make finding and using the map as easy as possible
4. Contribute to the [iPhone](https://github.com/openchattanooga/chamap-iphone-app) or [Andriod](https://github.com/openchattanooga/chamap-andriod-app) mobile app development.
